# SCAN_C-SCAN_ALGORITHMS
Created a Java-based simulation tool for SCAN and C-SCAN disk scheduling algorithms. The application computes seek time, generates seek sequences, and provides an interactive visualization of disk head movement, enabling clearer insights into disk I/O optimization techniques.
